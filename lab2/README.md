> At any state, you can put your stone on any one of the empty cells on the board. So the number of valid actions should be equal to number of empty cells at that state. Each action will generate a successor state. Initially the board is empty, so you will have 15X15 actions, and hence 15X15 valid successor states. Each of those states will once again have 15X15-1 successor states.
> And every time you choose an action, depth increases by 1. Once you reach max depth, you will need to evaluate all the states at that depth (The number will be very large).
> I would recommend trying out the algorithm on a tic-tac-toe board first. It follows the same logic.
