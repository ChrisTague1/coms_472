# Com S 472 Lab 1

## Running the Program

To run the progarm: `python main.py <<file>> <<alg>>`

> Note: `python` made need to be `python3`

Example:
```bash
python main.py Part2/some_sample.txt BFS
```

## Where to Find Things
- `main.py` has basic things in it, and checks if the inputed puzzle is solvable
- `bfs.py` has BFS implementation
- `ids.py` has IDS implementation
- `h1.py` has h1 implementation
- `h2.py` has h2 implementation
- `h3.py` has h3 implementation
- `part2.txt` has the runs required for part 2 of the lab
- `coms472_lab1_part3.pdf` has the table for part 3 of the lab
